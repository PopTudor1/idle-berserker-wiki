        <h2>⚠️ Maximize Your Potential</h2>
        <p>
          If you want to <strong>maximize your potential</strong>, don’t just
          blindly follow build guides and call it done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on where you are in the game, some strategies might work
          better than others.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best approach is to get the <strong>general idea</strong>, read up
          on tips, and <strong>test repeatedly</strong> until you find the setup
          that works best for you.
