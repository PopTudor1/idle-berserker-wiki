        <h2>ðŸ’Ž Diamonds Importance & Tips</h2>
        <p>
          Diamonds are crucial for summoning and are especially important during
          the <strong>Legend Chief Event</strong>, where{" "}
          <strong>100 diamonds = 1 point</strong>. Be sure to save your diamonds
          to aim for the top 10% or even higher rankings.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're a beginner, spend most of your diamonds on{" "}
          <strong>weapon, necklace, and ring summons</strong> until you get an
          SR. After that, focus your diamonds on{" "}
          <strong>creature summons</strong> until you unlock the{" "}
          <strong>Mythic Gate</strong>.
