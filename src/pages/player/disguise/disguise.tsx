        <h1>📘 Idle Berserker Starter Guide</h1>

        <h2>👋 Welcome Message</h2>
        <p>
          Hello Berserkers, I’ll do my best to organize this guide by key areas
          so you can easily find what suits your current progression and goals.
        </p>

        <h2>🚀 Starting a New Account</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>#1 advice</strong> for any new player is simple:{" "}
          <strong>keep the game running 24/7</strong>. Idling is the foundation
          of progress in <em>Idle Berserker</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For PC players, use an emulator like <strong>LDPlayer</strong> or{" "}
          <strong>Bluestacks</strong> — these are the most popular and reliable
          emulators available.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Note for iOS users:</strong> Currently, there’s no emulator
          support for iOS accounts. If you've started on an iPhone, you can’t
          log in to that same account on PC by default. However, some users have
          successfully transferred their accounts by contacting the developers
          via email.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether it’s on mobile or PC, running the game as much as possible is
          the biggest factor in your progression.
        </p>

        <h2>⏱️ How to Effectively Idle</h2>
        <p>
          Farming your <strong>highest stage</strong> isn’t always the most
          efficient. You’ll get better results from a{" "}
          <strong>lower stage with higher kill rates</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To find your most efficient farming stage, calculate your{" "}
          <strong>KPM (Kills Per Minute)</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Set a 60-second timer</li>
          <li>
            Track how many kills you get from the <em>Kill Monsters</em>{" "}
            repeating quest
          </li>
          <li>
            Aim for <strong>200+ KPM</strong>; ideal efficiency is around{" "}
            <strong>280–300</strong> KPM
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>💡 Why Idling 24/7 Is Crucial</h2>
        <p>
          Especially when you're just starting, idling is essential for gaining{" "}
          <strong>levels and resources</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your early goal should be reaching <strong>Level 5000</strong>. This
          unlocks <strong>Paragon</strong> and <strong>Paragon Levels</strong> —
          which provide <em>huge buffs</em> to attack, health, and farming
          speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep the game idling while charging your device or use low power mode
          — the long-term gains are 100% worth it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="guide-container">
        <h2>📈 CONTINUING: Why Idling is Essential</h2>
        <p>
          Leaving the game idling is the{" "}
          <strong>
            best way to earn gold, diamonds, and other valuable resources
          </strong>
          . One area that becomes increasingly irrelevant later on is the{" "}
          <strong>Goblin Dungeon</strong> — it gives out scarce resources and
          offers little value in mid-to-late game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another key material you’ll gain from idling is{" "}
          <strong>Enhancement Stones</strong>, which are used to level up your
          weapons. Enhancing your main weapon is one of the{" "}
          <strong>strongest early-game power boosts</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>🛡️ How to Reach SSR Weapons</h2>
        <p>
          Once again, <strong>idling is the best method</strong> to ascend your
          weapons and armor. You’ll get multiple copies of the same item faster
          than by rolling with diamonds.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Don’t waste diamonds</strong> on weapons, gauntlets, rings, or
          necklaces unless you’re just starting out. These rolls have
          diminishing returns as you progress.
        </p>

        <h2>🎯 Best Way to Spend Diamonds</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Focus your diamonds on skill summons</strong>. This should
            be your top priority.
          </li>
          <li>
            A good milestone is reaching the <strong>Grandmaster title</strong>{" "}
            — this gives you a rough benchmark for how many skills to pull for.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Creatures</strong> are occasionally mentioned as good
            targets for summoning, but this depends on your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            You mainly summon creatures early to unlock the{" "}
            <strong>Mythic Creature Gate</strong> or to roll the dice on a lucky
            drop.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Overall, early on it’s more valuable to funnel your diamonds into{" "}
          <strong>skill summons</strong> rather than gear or creatures.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="guide-container">
        <h2>📅 Daily Tasks</h2>
        <p>
          Logging in daily is <strong>essential</strong> for steady progression.
          Staying up to date with events ensures you can use them to your
          advantage and not miss out on important time-limited rewards.
        </p>

        <h3>✅ Daily Actions to Remember</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Summon your <strong>free daily items</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Clear your <strong>daily dungeon runs</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Buy out the normal shop</strong> using diamonds (smartly)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While you shouldn’t waste diamonds on{" "}
          <strong>enhancement stones or dice</strong> unless absolutely
          necessary, most of the other items in the shop are valuable. If you’re
          on a budget, prioritize buying:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Dragon Realm Keys</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Devastated Forest Keys</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ancient Ruins Keys</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scrolls & Companion Tokens</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Costume Shards</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>📌 Request System Importance</h3>
        <p>
          Requests are <strong>extremely important</strong>, especially in early
          game. Aside from progressing toward Paragon levels, another major
          milestone is raising your <strong>Awakening level</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Always <strong>reroll requests</strong> until you get a{" "}
          <strong>Dragon Realm Key</strong> request. Combining that with the
          daily shop purchases will greatly speed up how fast you awaken your
          Berserker.
        </p>

        <h2>💰 Is Spending Money Worth It?</h2>
        <p>
          This topic can be sensitive because of the divide between Free-to-Play
          (F2P) and Pay-to-Play (P2P) players.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a card user myself, I can confidently say there is one purchase I
          believe is worth the money: <strong>the Adblocker</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some say that even after buying the Adblocker, you’re still considered
          F2P — and I agree. It’s mostly a <em>quality of life</em> purchase.
        </p>
        <p>The benefits are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Faster completion of dailies, so it doesn’t feel like a chore</li>
          <li>
            An upgraded version offers <strong>extra dailies</strong>, which
            greatly help progression
          </li>
          <li>
            Unlocks the <strong>Oath of Blood</strong>, a passive boost that
            improves with playtime
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That said, I am not a financial advisor —{" "}
          <strong>this is not a necessity.</strong> Only purchase if you plan to
          play long-term, can afford it, and want to enjoy the game more
          comfortably!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="guide-container">
        <h2>🏟️ Arena</h2>
        <p>
          Arena might feel tough early on because it seems complicated, but it’s
          important to participate as you can earn free rewards with little
          effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start by copying skill builds from other players. Here’s a common
          average build I use, but it can vary from player to player.
        </p>
        <p>
          When picking opponents, focus on their <strong>trophies</strong>, not
          their power. Arena ranking and points depend on trophies, so defeating
          players with higher trophies gives more points.
        </p>
        <p>
          After each Arena reset, be sure to claim your rewards. These include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Title and banner</li>
          <li>Diamonds</li>
          <li>Arena coins</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Arena coins can be used to buy items, but I recommend saving them to
          get the <strong>SSR costume pieces</strong>, as those are the most
          worthwhile purchases.

        <h2>🤝 Guilds</h2>
        <p>
          Similar to Arena and dailies, joining a guild is very useful. It’s an
          easy way to make friends and find people who can help you if you’re
          stuck.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another benefit is the boosts and items you can unlock while part of a
          guild. Completing guild missions, guild conquest, and daily attendance
          will earn you <strong>Guild Coins</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>Guild Coins can be spent in the guild shop. You can buy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Feast Tickets - used to purchase buffs for your guild during the
            guild feast (e.g., 20% attack boost, 20% item drop boost)
          </li>
          <li>
            Scrolls - highly recommended as they allow you to summon cards,
            which are one of the most important parts of your build
          </li>

        <h2>🃏 Cards</h2>
        <p>Why are cards so important?</p>
        <p>
          Cards are crucial because they allow you to deal bonus damage in
          specific areas. Each card has different tags related to different
          zones or bosses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideally, you want to collect full sets of cards for each area or stage
          preset. For example, having a full set of Ancient Desert cards means
          when you’re fighting a boss or enemies in Ancient Desert, you will
          deal bonus damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          This setup helps you swap card sets depending on the stage you are
          pushing, maximizing your damage output.
        </p>
        <div style={{ textAlign: "center", margin: "20px 0" }}>

      <div className="guide-container">
        <h2>⚡ What Element Should I Choose</h2>
        <p>
          Currently, <strong>Infernal</strong> is considered the strongest
          element overall, but all elements have their unique strengths.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Nature creatures</strong> often have perks that make them
          excellent for farming, while <strong>Infernal creatures</strong> are
          usually more damage-focused.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s highly recommended to stick to one element to keep your world
          stones aligned and maximize your power output. That doesn’t mean you
          won’t occasionally use other elements—like Nature creatures for
          farming perks—but your main focus should stay consistent.
        </p>
        <p>Elemental effectiveness against bosses works like this:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Celestial &gt; Infernal</li>
          <li>Infernal &gt; Nature</li>
          <li>Nature &gt; Celestial</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Even with these matchups, focusing purely on one element is strongly
          recommended until you reach late game.

        <h2>💰 Is This Worth To Buy?</h2>
        <p>
          If you're considering <strong>spending money</strong> in the game and
          feel unsure, it's always a good idea to <em>ask first!</em> You can
          send me a <strong>private message</strong>, reply in this guide’s
          comments, or ask in the main chat. There are plenty of experienced
          players happy to help you decide if a purchase is{" "}
          <strong>worth it</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>
          🔥 <strong>Demon Power</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Demon Power is a <em>newer feature</em> in the game, so it’s still
          fresh and evolving. I haven’t done full calculations yet, but it’s a{" "}
          <strong>very strong boost—even for free-to-play players.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>My personal recommendation:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Level up each weapon evenly.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            You don’t need to have the weapon equipped to benefit from its Demon
            Power effects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Having all your SSR weapons at a similar level{" "}

        <h2>COMPANIONS</h2>
        <p>
          Early on companions are kind of <em>RNG</em> as some are{" "}
          <strong>very useful</strong> and some are <strong>very bad</strong>.
          However, in general you will want to{" "}
          <strong>collect them all and ascend them all to max</strong> in the
          end. This is because as you ascend you can get{" "}
          <strong>buffs from their talents and companion bonds</strong>, as seen
          below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting off early, the big companions that are{" "}
          <strong>very useful</strong> are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Targon</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Astia</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Valder</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hacon</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Olga</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The majority of <strong>SR companions</strong> are useful; however, a
          lot of the <strong>SSR companions</strong> aren't unfortunately.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Tip:</strong> Every time you ascend a companion you can{" "}
          <strong>reroll their talents</strong> again and it'll give you more
          buffs, so you have to remember to{" "}
          <strong>reroll them every time you ascend a companion</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These talent buffs also work as an effect when owned, so{" "}
          <strong>
            you do not have to use the companion to have the buffs active
          </strong>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          With companions it is also necessary to have the{" "}
          <strong>correct tag effects on their equipment</strong> so you can
          utilise the buffs from having the same tags, as seen in the picture.
        </p>

        <h2>COSTUMES</h2>
        <p>
          I have previously mentioned that{" "}
          <strong>buying the costume shards are important</strong>, this is
          because costumes are needed to be done properly to advance through the
          game.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you equip a costume you can add <strong>buffs</strong> to them,
          similar to the cards you will want to have different <em>presets</em>{" "}
          for different things.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the first preset you should make is{" "}
          <strong>Stage Boss Monster Attack</strong>. This simply means you will
          be doing so much more damage when you are fighting the Stage Boss.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also means you can have presets for other bosses such as the{" "}
          <strong>Dragon Realm</strong>, and also{" "}
          <strong>Stage monsters</strong>, meaning when you are farming you'll
          be stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, with the costumes you{" "}
          <strong>must have the preset equipped to gain the bonuses.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>WHAT IS ABOH?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>ABOH (Attack based on HP)</strong> is an{" "}
          <em>endgame build</em>, which means the more health you have, the
          higher your attack becomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          To work it out simply, if you have <strong>300% ABOH</strong>:
        </p>
        <p>
          Every <strong>1000 Health = 3000 Attack</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          This leads to <strong>massive damage increases</strong>. The only
          reason it is considered an endgame build is because of the rarity and
          difficulty in gaining the ABOH stat, which mainly comes from{" "}
          <strong>Paragon points and costumes.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          So early on, just put all your points and resources into damage as you
          want to focus on what is called the{" "}
          <strong>GC build (Glass Cannon)</strong>. The idea is to try and
          one-shot the boss before it one-shots you. In most cases, health is
          pretty useless because bosses will one-shot you either way (even as
          ABOH).
